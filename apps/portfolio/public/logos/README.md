# Logos

This folder powers the brand “logo wall” on the portfolio homepage.

Default behavior uses lightweight, typographic wordmark SVGs (not official marks).
If you want to use official brand marks, replace the files in here with the approved assets you have rights to use, then update `logoSrc` in `apps/portfolio/components/LogoWall.tsx`.

## Conventions

- Put assets under `apps/portfolio/public/logos/...` so they are served at `/logos/...`.
- Prefer monochrome SVGs that work on dark backgrounds.
- Keep a consistent visual height (roughly 28–32px) and let width vary.
