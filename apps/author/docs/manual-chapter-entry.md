# Manual Chapter Entry (Sanity)

This guide is for adding private manuscript chapters to Sanity Studio. These chapters are not part of public writing content and should remain private.

## Where
- Open the studio at `/cms`.
- Create a new document of type **Manuscript Chapter**.

## Required Fields
- **Manuscript Key**: use a stable key such as `some-peoples-kids`.
- **Order**: chapter order number (1, 2, 3, ...).
- **Chapter Label**: display label (example: `Chapter One`).
- **Content**: paste the full chapter text into the Portable Text editor.

## Optional Fields
- **Title**: use if the chapter has a distinct title (optional).

## Entry Steps (Chapters 1–3)
1) Create three **Manuscript Chapter** documents.
2) Set **Manuscript Key** to the same key for all three.
3) Set **Order** to 1, 2, and 3.
4) Set **Chapter Label** to `Chapter One`, `Chapter Two`, `Chapter Three`.
5) Paste the chapter text into **Content** and save.

## Notes
- These documents are queried only by `manuscriptKey` and order ranges.
- Do not create public listings or references from `writing` content.
