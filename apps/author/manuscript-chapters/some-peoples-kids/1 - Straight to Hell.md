My dad kills the engine and the Crown Vic ticks as it cools. Rain beads on the hood. The building sits across the slick asphalt, waiting.
The lot is empty.
The building is nothing. Flat, faded, cheap. Above the entrance: HOPE HOUSE in green letters, but the ghost of HOTEL bleeds through the stucco, like somebody painted over a crime scene and hoped nobody would notice.
He won’t look at me. He’s in uniform, badge catching the gray light, hands locked on the wheel.
I finish the last of a drive‑thru burger and wipe my fingers on my jeans. Grease and salt and that aftertaste you can’t wash off. He glances over like he’s about to say something normal—Love you. Be good. See you Sunday—then his mouth opens, then shuts.
“So,” I say, too casual for how sealed the car feels. “We heading home or what?” I ball up the wrapper and jam it into the cup holder.
My dad turns his head, white knuckles bracing for impact, the uniform too tight across his shoulders.
He says, “You’re not coming home, Strummer.”
The sentence doesn’t fit at first; it belongs to somebody else’s kid.
I blink. “What?”
“You’re staying here.” He says it to the windshield, not to me: “Hope House.”
I point at the sign like it might correct him. “HOPE HOUSE? What the fuck are you talking about, Dad?”
His jaw jumps once. “It’s a good place. Nine months and you’re eighteen. Just—stick it out. Follow the rules. Finish probation.” He stops on whatever he was about to call it—love, guilt, fear—and backs away from the word. “Then we talk. But for now, kiddo—”
“For now?” I hear my laugh before I mean it. It comes out sharp. “You drop me at a shelter and call it a day?”
I cut my eyes at the uniform, the badge. “Take that off and be my dad. Not—whatever this is.”
“Enough.” He drags a hand down his face, like he can wipe this away. “You think I want this?”
He looks at the building and back, quick, like he’s afraid I’ll see too much. “Six months in rehab doesn’t wipe anything clean. You got lucky—your PO and I pulled favors. Instead of a cell, you’re going to a shelter.”
Not juvie. Not bars. A teen shelter—kids who ran out of couches and chances. Same leash, different label. Dad and Harper pulled strings because home isn’t “home” anymore. Home is where I die slow.
Shelter is a word that sounds like safety until you’ve slept under fluorescent lights with your shoes on.
His voice drops. Quieter. Meaner because it’s true. “Your stepmother’s scared of you.”
He doesn’t say her name. He doesn’t have to. The thought lodges, then blooms, and that night pops open and I’m falling through—

I’m back in bed, sheets tangled around my legs, and my dad’s fist is in my hoodie, dragging me into the hall. Drywall shudders, frames rattle on their hooks, my stepmother’s voice comes thin and far away through a vent, like she’s calling from another house. Blue strobes, copper under my tongue. I run, shoes sliding on spilled beer, not looking back because looking back would make it real.
The passenger window clouds from my breath.
“Harper Vaughn will be here Friday,” my dad says. “Probation wants you settled. If she doesn’t like what she sees—” He stops, but he doesn’t need to finish.
The sign across the lot blurs at the edges, smeared and out of focus.
Screw this up and it’s two years inside. At seventeen, that’s forever. Inside means county. Adult. They already decided I’m grown when it’s convenient—cinderblock, real men, and my sentence waiting to finish me.
He doesn’t wait for me to answer. The glovebox pops. A pack of cigarettes lands in my lap. A lighter clacks onto the pack. Then a wad of bills on top, soft and dense.
“Walk‑around money,” he says.
I lift the cash like I might set it on the dash and leave it there, let him wonder what it costs to abandon your kid; I don’t. I shove it deep in my pocket anyway because I’m not brave. I’m cornered.
“I love you, Strummer.” His voice catches on my name like it hurts him too. “Don’t fuck this up.”
A thunk from the back. Trunk release.
He steps out and circles to the trunk, grabs my bag and my guitar case, sets them on the curb.
Evidence drop. Not a goodbye. He never looks at me when he does it.
I shove the door open and the air cuts right through my hoodie. The lot reeks of asphalt and stale smoke; the place has been exhaling for years.
“Wait—” I swing my legs out and grab the guitar case strap. “Is this my guitar? I pawned it.”
He pauses with his hand on the buzzer by the door. “I found it.”
"Grandpa's watch?" The words slip out before I can catch them.
"That I wasn't able to track down." His voice goes flat, cop voice. He taps the buzzer.
The maglock releases with a thunk, final as sentencing to me.
That settles in me. Another thing that’s gone. Another thing that doesn’t come back just because you’re “trying.”
I shoulder the bag and grab the guitar. The case knocks my knee, strap cutting into my shoulder. My dad walks ahead like he’s escorting me in, not leaving me.
Inside, it’s warmer. It doesn’t help. Disinfectant, old coffee, worn carpet.
Behind the desk, a woman with graying hair and wire‑rims checks her clipboard without looking up. She keeps her posture set and neutral.
The counter is scuffed. The pen is chained to it. The carpet has gone bald where feet turn, and the laminated sheets on the wall curl at the corners.
Her nameplate reads CAROL BAKER. She flips a page, eyes down. “Strummer?”
My dad stops behind me and puts his hands on my shoulders. Weight through the hoodie. Not comfort. Control. “Present,” he says.
She finally looks up, quick scan—shoes, hoodie, eyes—then checks the clipboard, ticks a box, and writes a quick note. I shift, trying to shrug his hands off, and her eyes track the movement. Then she sets the pen down.
"Room 107," she says, pointing toward a battered office door that opens onto the courtyard beyond. "Orientation is at nine tomorrow. Dinner's at six. Group is mandatory. Three strikes."
"Structure keeps this place operating. Boundaries keep you safe."
"Gate locks at night. Curfew's curfew," she adds. "Keep close to the entrance if you smoke. Most kids can sign out if they follow rules."
Rules for them. Not for me. Harper reads the report. Three strikes becomes her report, then a judge, then county.
On the corner of her desk, a small photo frame sits facedown.
I clock it because my brain can’t not look for the human part.
Carol catches my glance and slides the frame into a drawer fast. The drawer clicks shut, and her face sets again.
My dad steps up beside me and clears his throat. His hand stays on my shoulder, same pressure, same claim.
"You'll be okay," he says. "Just try."
I tried. From the first time I had to put on a borrowed tie and sit in front of a judge with my feet not touching the floor, through church basements with cold coffee and a white chip sweating in my palm, through intake windows where I said Yes, I'm clean while I pissed in a cup and prayed. I tried for six months in rehab, counting tiles and signing worksheets and telling strangers my worst day like it was small talk.
It didn't matter.
I keep my mouth shut; something ugly wants out.
No "I love you." No "I'll see you soon."
The buzzer drones. The front door seals behind him.
Through the front‑door glass I watch my dad walk back across the lot and fold into the Crown Vic like it's just another call, just another stop. Rain stipples the roof. He never once looks over his shoulder; the brake lights don't blink.
The engine turns. The car rolls away. It shrinks into the gray until it could've been a thing I invented to explain why I'm here.
The lighter he gave me feels stupid in my pocket, some last‑minute fathering he can justify later, like tossing a dog a bone on the way out the door.
I shift the bag on my shoulder and look at Carol. The guitar drags at me.
“Can I smoke first?” I ask, like needing a minute requires paperwork.
She adjusts her glasses. “Out front. Come right back.”
I keep my stuff with me. Not yet.
I hike the bag higher and keep my fist hooked in the guitar strap. If I’m already getting dropped off, I’m not letting my last two pieces of proof walk off without me.
A kid shoulders through the front door, sneaker wedged under it so it won’t bang. He slips by me, unfazed, grocery‑store casual, like this is just another door.
I slip out before Carol can change her mind.
The awning covers a caged entryway. Street gate ahead. Office window to the right. The awning rattles above me. The lot shines under the light, and I set the bag and guitar case against the brick by my boot, close enough that if someone tries something, I’ll see it coming.
A voice—
“Got another one of those?”
I look over.
She’s propped against the brick as though she belongs there. Curls glued to her neck, knuckles scabbed, hoodie darkened and clinging. She doesn’t seem to notice the weather.
Her gaze jumps to the office window, then back to me—quick and practiced.
I shake a cigarette loose and hold it out.
“Light?” she says.
“Yeah.”
I thumb the lighter.
“Thanks.”
She steps in close, palm cupped over mine against the elements. Our fingers nearly touch. The flare warms us both. Her skin smells like smoke and something sharp—cheap soap, maybe. The paper crackles as the cherry takes.
“Name?”
“Strummer.”
“Cop’s kid, right?”
“That’s the story.”
“Baker said you’d be here.”
“News travels.”
“It does.”
She draws and lets it out slow, watching the smoke like it might confess.
“Welcome to paradise,” she says.
“Hell Lite, really.”
“Sure.”
Not mean, just tired.
She runs her eyes down and back up, taking inventory. Guitar case. Bag. The way I’m standing too stiff.
A band logo is worn thin on her hoodie. A studded belt sits crooked at her hips, buckled in a hurry.
Her heel taps once against the concrete and then settles.
She passes the cigarette back and I take it like this is normal, like we’re just kids under an awning and not inmates with different uniforms.
She gives me a quick nod—her full allowance of kindness—and turns toward the street gate. Her shoulders gloss under the light as she pushes through. The hinge complains. The bars are higher than they need to be, like they’re afraid of what kids will do if you give them an inch.
She slips out through the gate and is gone.
The cigarette burns down and ash drops onto my shoe. I leave it. The spot she went through stays open—just the gate hinge settling back into place like it’s satisfied with itself.
I crush the butt under my shoe. It hisses and goes dark.
For a beat the sound hangs under the awning, louder than it should be.
It’s just the awning and the hiss again.
The asphalt stink hangs under the awning. I stand there longer than I should.
I adjust the bag strap and hook the guitar strap higher. The case knocks my knee as I turn. The strap cuts the same groove into my shoulder as before, like the building already owns the shape of me.
I wait.
The door waits; the handle bites, metal on skin.
I pull, and the door swings in.
I step inside.
