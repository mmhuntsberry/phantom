Carol’s still at her desk, doesn’t look up, and there’s no point lingering where a clipboard can see you breathe. Not yet.
I push through the door into the courtyard.
The air tastes like wet concrete and old cigarettes, and the sky sits low, dull as sheet metal, and the doors line up in a row with number plates scratched down to brass, everything here temporary on purpose.
I follow the numbers to Room 107.
The door sticks, then gives with a shrill scrape, desperate for credit.
“Yo,” a voice rumbles. “You the new guy?”
Two twin beds: one made tight, one a tangle of blankets and clothes, smaller, grimy, someone else’s chaos. A crude stick‑and‑poke bird scars his forearm.
On the messy side sits a mountain of a kid, legs sprawled, a bag of chips on his chest as he eats in a slow claim, crumbs dusting his shirt.
The room smells like sweat and chips and something sweet trying to cover it, and it clings to the walls.
“Right,” I say. Easy grin, automatic. The kind you use when you don’t know the rules yet and you’re trying to look like you do. I drop my bag on the neat bed, lean the guitar against the wall, resisting the urge to back out and pretend I got the wrong room.
He finally glances up, still crunching. “Strummer, right? Heard Carol talking.” A smirk. “Cool name. Like The Clash.”
“Something like that.” I tap the bed frame with my boot. It holds, small mercy.
“I’m Nicky,” he says, offering a palm slick with chip grease.
I hesitate, and he shrugs, lets his hand drop. His eyes flicker a fraction, then he overcorrects. “Welcome to the worst place you’ll ever live,” he says. “You’ll get used to it.”
His gaze drifts to the guitar case. “You play?”
“Only when I’m feeling particularly masochistic.”
Nicky snorts. “Fair enough.”
I keep the door at my back and my bag within reach, I clock the room fast—exits, corners, what’s mine, what isn’t—and up close the tattoo lines look pecked into skin, more stubborn than pretty. He’s big, but it’s not just that. He owns the space without standing up.
I can feel it.
He taps a dented Altoids tin against his palm, one metallic tap, then flips it to me. “Mint?”
The lid gives a little, and skunk and sugar jump out.
I picture office blinds twitching, Carol’s eyes on us, Harper’s eyes on my file, and I snap it shut and set it back on his bed, careful, bait.
“Keep that off the floor,” I say. “I don’t need that pinned on me.”
His eyes narrow. “You think I’m dumb? I know the rules.” He tosses the tin onto the nightstand; it lands with a metallic crack. His face sets. “You don’t smoke?”
“Not today.”
That hangs there between us, not a joke or a confession, just a line in the sand I’m not sure I can hold.
Silence stretches between us for a beat.
He crushes the chip bag in his fist, then forces a laugh. A short bark, too sharp for the room. “You’ll survive,” he says. “Probably.”
His gaze flicks to my bag, the smirk thinning. “Don’t unpack.”
“What?”
“Don’t unpack,” he repeats, voice flat. He dusts his fingers on the blanket. “Carol watches. Once you’re on her list, she writes whatever she wants.”
The way he says it makes the room thin. Not fear exactly. More the sense the air’s going to run out and nobody’s going to admit it until it’s gone.
He leans back, cracking his knuckles. “Survive’s my brand.” He overdoes the wink; it hangs a beat too long, waiting to see if I’ll laugh so he can decide what I am. Then he starts humming, off‑key, words half‑formed, making a song out of the rules, stealing power back the only way he can:
“Welcome to Hope House, where the doors all lock
Four walls and a bed, and you don’t belong—”
“Thanks for the vote of confidence,” I say, biting my cheek hard enough to taste it. The space between us goes cold, measured. I need out. “I’m going to check out the place.”
“Wait, I’m not done—” Nicky starts, but I’m already moving.
He talks over me anyway. “Suit yourself. Same walls, same day. And if you think that song was bad, wait till you hear my breakfast jingle.”
I step back into the courtyard and let the cold damp hit my face and clear me.

I’m not here to make friends. Friends are leverage, witnesses, attachments.
That’s the rule.
No one looks my way, good, and they keep their eyes down, shoulders pulled up like the hoodies can hide them.
Doors in a row, all identical, the payphone by the office window hanging crooked, receiver dangling, cord knotted from too many desperate calls, and nothing here feels private or new.
I drift toward the sliding glass door.
Through it, a TV pulses in the common room. Kids huddle around a console. One slams a controller with a muffled shout, too sharp, too close, and the sound snaps the room sideways.
I slide the door open. Warmth and TV glare spill over me as I step inside.
“Lost already?”
A woman leans in the kitchen doorway, just off the common room, dark hair in a messy ponytail, an apron that reads I’m Not Your Mom; her eyes track me, not unkind, not soft either, just awake.
“Sabine,” she says, wiping her hands. “Cook. Counselor. Referee. You?”
“Strummer.”
“Well, Strummer. If you’re gonna stand there, grab a crate. Make yourself useful.” She hooks a thumb at the boxes stacked along the wall. “Delivery came this morning. It ain’t unloading itself.”
“I just got here—”
“And?” she cuts in. “Everyone works. Everyone eats. That’s the deal.” She tilts her head toward the kitchen and dares me with it. “Perfect time for you to learn the kitchen.”
I don’t test it. I grab a crate of beans, cereal, a milk carton warm when it shouldn’t be, and follow Sabine in.
The kitchen’s huge, an old diner that refuses to die, pots and pans hanging from hooks, counters stacked with groceries salvaged from clearance bins, and it smells like fryer oil that never leaves and lemon cleaner trying to, the kind that never wins.
The floor is slick in spots, and the tiles under my boots feel soft from years of scrubbing.
A short, wiry kid lines up snack cakes into a pyramid with the focus of someone building a shrine.
“Cooler’s back here,” Sabine says, tapping my crate. “Watch the latch.”
Cold spills out when I open it. I slide the milk onto a wire shelf, park the beans and cereal on a rack. The cooler hums steady, the one thing in the building that insists on consistency.
When I turn, the kid’s still building his sugar tower.
“That’s Johnny,” Sabine says. “Resident sugar fiend. Try not to get in his way.”
“Welcome to the tank, fish,” Johnny says without looking up. He tears into a donut and grabs another. The pyramid wobbles. He steadies it, still not looking at me. I’m just another box to stack.
I glance at Sabine, and she rolls her eyes dramatically, trying to keep the place from swallowing itself with humor.
“Thanks,” I say. “I guess.”
I grab another crate of beans, more cereal, dented soup, and start unloading. The stack shrinks, but my shoulders are already tight, like they’ve been holding my whole life up.
Sabine watches me, arms crossed, measuring whether I’m going to be a problem or just loud about being hurt.
“Since you’re new,” she says, “here’s the deal. You miss dish duty, you miss dinner. Carol turns it into a file.” She points at the chore wheel. Above it, in marker that’s been rewritten a thousand times: EVERYONE WORKS. EVERYONE EATS.
She drags a marker under DISHES and writes my name.
Two names are already written there. DARBY and a blank space like someone hasn’t shown up yet, or someone got erased.
“In here,” Sabine says, cap clicking back on, “you pull your weight and you’re fine. Make my life harder, I’ll make yours harder.”
It’s said flat, not a threat, a law.
A kid I hadn’t noticed before, maybe fifteen, maybe sixteen, drifts toward the kitchen door, tray in hand. Sabine doesn’t look up, but her voice slices sharp anyway.
“Not through there. Back door. You know the rule.”
The kid freezes, then nods and turns without a word. Sabine doesn’t raise her voice; she doesn’t have to. They just listen.
The room goes still, and I keep moving beans to shelves, eyes down.
By the time the food’s unloaded, my back aches and my patience is shot. My hands smell like cardboard and milk that should’ve been cold. The kitchen lights whine overhead, drilling at the back of my skull.
Sabine steps close and pats my shoulder.
“Dinner’s at six,” she says. “Don’t be late. It’s about the only time anyone here acts like they give a damn.”
Her hand, warm and solid—the first human touch I’ve had since I got here that isn’t a grip, or a shove, or a badge‑shaped promise. Not hostile or testing, just… there.
My body wants to fold into it. Wants to believe someone gives a shit. Warmth seeps into my shoulder and down my arm, loosening something I’ve been holding for so long it feels fused. Then the cold returns, not from her but from inside me.
I remember where I am, what’s at stake, what happens when you let your guard down and somebody decides that makes you weak. I step back, reflexive.
Sabine clocks it.
She doesn’t comment. Just nods once. She’s seen it a hundred times, and she’s not here to make it worse.
“See you at dinner,” she says, turning back to the counters.
I’m heading for the door when Johnny calls, “Later, fish.”
Sabine doesn’t look up. “His name’s Strummer, Johnny. Use it.”
Johnny mutters something that might be my name, might not. He doesn’t argue.
I push into the common room, empty now, TV giving off that thin hiss as the sound sits in the corners and waits.
The office door stands propped open with a doorstop, and through it I catch the corkboard, the bottom line in red like a stamped order:
PO VISITS FRIDAY — HARPER VAUGHN
Friday. My probation officer.
One slip and it’s ink on her desk.
I can’t stay in the stale silence. I slide the door open and step back into the courtyard. Outside feels cleaner than the fluorescent glare.

I’m halfway to 107 when a voice breaks through.
“Hey, new guy.”
From above. I look up at the second‑floor walkway.
Same girl from under the awning. She’s there, forearms on the railing, one heel ticking metal (tap, pause, tap), keeping time for a song only she can hear, same faded band hoodie, studded belt, same look as earlier, like she’s already decided what the place is and refuses to pretend otherwise. So she came back in.
Of course she did. Everyone comes back in. The door always locks behind you.
Not because it’s jail—because it’s a shelter. Because I’m the one on a leash.
She watches me, waiting.
“Hate it already?”
“I do.”
“Good. You’ll fit.”
Her eyes flick toward 107. “Watch yourself with Nicky. Short fuse. Don’t touch his stuff. I’ve seen the pattern.”
I start to ask how she knows. If she’s seen him blow. If she’s seen what happens after. But she’s already turning away. No follow‑ups.
“See you around, Strummer,” she says, and then she’s gone, swallowed by whatever door her life is behind.
The walkway’s empty, but her warning sticks, bitter and thin.
I head for 107, and for the first time since I got here, I’m not just counting days.
I’m running through the ways this could go wrong.
No mistakes.
Nicky blowing up if I move something that’s his, the weed smell clinging to my clothes even though I didn’t touch it, a door left cracked after ten, a cup under the bed, a strike I don’t see coming until it’s ink on her desk.
Three strikes and Harper owns my next two years.
Here, that might be enough to bury me.
