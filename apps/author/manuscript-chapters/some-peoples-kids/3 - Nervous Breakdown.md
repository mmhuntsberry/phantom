They cut off my treatment-center band this morning—six months on my wrist in plastic—and send me out with discharge papers that still smell like toner. No ceremony. My dad drops me at Hope House before lunch.
By dinner, the common room closes over me. Kids pour in—hoodies and elbows and noise—and I get stuck near the sliding glass door, pinned there by the traffic. The tables run the room's length so the crowd feels longer than it is. Plastic forks bounce too loud while a kid in a football tee keeps banging his knee against the edge. A girl peels the label off her water bottle in ribbons. Johnny lobs sugar packets at cups, misses, grins anyway. Nicky laughs and half the table angles toward him, pulled by whatever force he puts off. It feels like a tide, and I'm stuck at the edge.
The noise stacks up fast.
I stay near the glass and copy the veterans, one shoulder to the wall, face blank, shoes braced by table legs, trying not to take up space or invite it.
The wall’s cool against my back, steadying me.
I breathe in for four, out for seven, again, again, and make it through three rounds with my hands buried in my pockets, thumb rubbing the seam of my jeans, trying to wear myself down into something smaller.
At the serving line by the kitchen door, Sabine works damage control, ponytail swinging as she slides trays loaded with beige casserole, sticky potatoes that hold the scoop’s shape, and beans boiled to army-green. Steam fogs her glasses. She wipes them with the corner of her apron, muttering. A pop of grease snaps off metal, sharp enough to make me flinch.
Sabine’s eyes flick up—quick, sharp—clocking where I’m posted by the glass like it’s an escape hatch. Then she goes right back to the trays like she didn’t just read me in one glance.
No one else looks up from their plates.
“Move, people,” she calls, smacking the counter. “Eat, survive, no refunds.”
The line creeps forward, shoes scraping grit across the linoleum.
Nicky already owns the far end of the room. It’s his table, one knee in the aisle, and a kid in a hoodie hovers at his elbow, strings chewed, nodding half a beat ahead—street team for the Church of Nicky. He’d hand out pamphlets if they printed them. He sweeps crumbs toward Nicky as an offering and watches for dissent. He doesn’t need to try; the room shifts toward him anyway.
I drift to the back of the line and let kids cut.
Easier to be last, easier to be forgettable for a minute.
When my turn comes, Sabine squints through the steam. “Strummer.” She clocks the way I’m trying to disappear and refuses to let me. “Back wall, not the courtyard door. Eat first, spiral after. If you plant yourself, they’ll pin you.”
She slides the tray into my hands and tucks a napkin under my thumb, anchoring me to the present. “Go.”
I nod, and the tray wobbles anyway.
The food smells like warm paste and regret, nothing like food.
I take the long way, skirting seat backs until a gap opens by the back wall, and when I drop into the empty chair I keep my head down and the wall holds behind me like a second spine. I get one forkful in.
A spoon taps plastic.
Tap tap tap, like a metronome, even enough to borrow.
The beat stays true.
It keeps me upright.
The rhythm catches me and drags me somewhere safer. I plant my heel against the floor and snap the beat under the table, quiet and controlled.
The sound yanks me back to seventh grade.
Lunch. Standing by the foosball table, part of the furniture. Rods squeaking. The plastic ball bouncing off walls and spinning into the goal. I keep score and don’t say a word. The minute hand crawls. The bell takes a year.
Get through dinner, don’t draw eyes, keep your head down.
“Hey, fish.”
Johnny stands on his seat, fork pointed at the ceiling like he’s making a speech. Heads pivot. Hands pause over plates. The room waits for whatever show he’s about to put on.
“What’d you do to get hooked?” he shouts. “Spill it.”
Dammit, no.
Attention drops, heavy and familiar, at the base of my neck.
I slide the fork onto the napkin so it won’t ring. Hands under the table, fingers hooked on the seat edge. Eyes on a nick in the tray. Don’t react, don’t feed it.
I open my mouth—
Sabine’s shout cuts through from the line, clean and loud. Johnny drops back into his seat. Noise returns. Forks, trays, voices. Eyes slide off me and move on.
Oh, thank God. Not all of them.
Across the table, chin on stacked bracelets, a girl idles her fork through beans like she’s bored with the whole planet. Her eyes settle on my hands clamped around the seat.
“Careful,” she says, a quick smirk. “You look like you’re about to bend that thing in half.”
She nudges a bean aside, then meets my gaze like it’s nothing.
“I’m Darby.”
The name catches. Small sound, big impact. The spoon scrapes her bowl, once, twice—regular.
“Strummer,” I say. “You already knew that.”
She gives a half smile. Tiny test passed.
“We’re on dishes,” I add, because my brain loves useless facts when it’s cornered. “Together. I mean… at the sink.”
“Easy,” she says. “It’s soap, not a date.”
I nod, but my attention splits anyway. Around us, seat backs thump and trays clatter as the tables empty, and kids drift toward the TV in a slow current, the nightly ritual pulling them across the room.
The set waits on the far wall, couch facing it with its back to the sliding glass door to the courtyard, a barricade in cheap upholstery.
“House rule,” Darby says, following my gaze. “Winner controls the TV. Nicky’s been champ for weeks; no one challenges him.” She stirs beans, narrating weather. “Most kids don’t try. Not worth it.”
The TV hisses again.
The sound needles.
A snap, then blue-white snow blooms, bright and cold, and the hiss cuts through the chatter.
The hiss holds, constant, and my shoulders climb before I can stop them. I force another bite, chew too fast.
“How long have you been here?” I ask, because questions feel like control.
“Eight months.” She doesn’t look up. “Nicky’s the record holder, been here way longer. I’m almost seventeen. Got about a year left.”
“Eight months,” I repeat.
Stupid.
She glances over, one eyebrow raised. “You’re doing that thing where you repeat what I said. Processing thing or just bad at conversation?”
My face goes hot. “Both, probably.”
“Honest. I’ll take it.” She nudges a bean with her fork. “Court said I can’t stay with my aunt anymore. Too many ‘incidents.’” She makes finger quotes. “So here I am.”
I nod. “What about your parents?”
Her fork stills. Just for a second, enough to matter.
“Not in the picture,” she says, flat, final. Then, paying for my question with one of her own, “What about yours? Besides the cop dad thing.”
The deflection’s obvious. I let it slide anyway.
“Haven’t seen them in years,” I say. “Just the cop dad and a stepmom who’s scared of me. Not exactly a Hallmark card.”
“Fair enough.” She shrugs, eyes drifting back toward the TV glow. “At least the food’s consistently terrible. Predictability’s underrated.”
Across the room, someone yells, “You’re cheating!” and the crowd closes in around the couch, Nicky planted in the middle, controller loose in his hands, grin sharpened to a point, every hit dragging fresh cheers off the walls.
“Did you see that? Did you see that?” Nicky’s voice cuts over the game’s sound effects, loud and invasive. He narrates every move, every hit. The room is his witness. “That’s how you do it! Boom! Right in the face! And now—oh, here comes the combo, watch this, watch this—”
I chew, swallow, chew again. The racket builds, the game, the cheers, Nicky’s running commentary layering over everything until it turns into one thick blanket I can’t get out from under, and I keep my back to the wall anyway.
Johnny edges into the circle around the couch. He stands at the edge, shoulders hunched, hands twisting, trying to wring himself out.
“Come on,” he says, voice cracking. “My show’s on tonight.” His neck’s blotchy red. “Just—just let me get it for once.”
Nicky doesn’t look back. “Cry about it.”
Johnny looks at Darby first. Wrong move. She stays with her food at our table, wrist resting on bracelets, not letting herself get dragged in. Then he turns to me, rubbing his palms on his jeans.
“Please,” he says. “Fish. If nobody knocks him off, I’m screwed.”
Nicky keeps talking to the screen as if the rest of us are scenery.
Something in me cinches.
Not anger yet. Not bravery.
Just the sense that if I don’t do something small now, I’ll spend the whole night watching someone else decide what I’m allowed to have.
I shove my tray forward and stand.
One step along the back wall toward the sliding glass door. Another, behind the couch, trying to stay invisible.
Nicky’s arm shoots out without warning and catches me in the ribs as I pass. Not hard enough to bruise, just hard enough to claim me.
He doesn’t look up.
“Stay put, rookie,” he says. “You’ll get a shot when I’m done.”
Johnny’s shoulders fold inward like he expected this. Like he lives here.
If I let it slide, Nicky owns tomorrow too.
“Let him watch his show,” I say.
That gets Nicky’s attention.
He finally looks up, eyes narrowing like he’s sighting a target. “Hold on, hold on—” he cuts me off before I can add anything. “You’re interrupting the game here. Can’t you see I’m in the middle of something?”
A slow grin creeps in. He’s been waiting for me to do exactly this.
“So tell me,” he says, “why should I?”
He bumps the controller against my knee, light but pointed, warning dressed up as a joke.
“You want him to have the TV,” he says, “then you play me for it.”
The whole room shifts.
Conversation drops, bottles hover, and kids clear a pocket of space around the couch, backing toward the tables until there’s a clean ring of air and I’m stuck between the couch and the wall with the sliding glass door at my side, an exit that doesn’t open.
“For fuck’s sake.” I exhale hard. “Fine. If I win, the TV’s his.”
Nicky’s grin cuts wider, all teeth. “Best two outta three.”
“Won’t need three.”
He barks a laugh. “Cocky motherfucker. I love it.”
“Language!” Sabine snaps from the kitchen.
He throws a half-hearted “Sorry” over his shoulder, still smiling.
A beat later, Sabine’s voice again, louder, the kind that makes the whole building straighten.
“And Nicky? If you break another controller, you’re replacing it. Not Carol. Not the house. You. Understood?”
Nicky’s grin falters.
He doesn’t answer, but his shoulders drop a fraction. The whole room feels it. The shift.
Sabine isn’t just staff. She’s law.
She’s the one who makes the rules stick.
Nicky leans back, still pretending he owns the couch, the room, the night. “Choose.”
I take the controller.
My palms are damp. Thumbs settle. I stand there while Nicky stays on the couch, king refusing to rise.
I keep my eyes on him.
Don’t blink.
The TV screen blooms: Street Fighter II on an old Super Nintendo, its plastic yellowed with age, and it lands harder than it should.
I pick Guile (always Guile), muscle memory waking intact.
Basement carpet under my knees, hand-me-down console buzzing, my brothers and sisters crowding in, never giving me a turn unless I can take it; I’m the youngest, invisible unless I win.
I wake early, practicing flash-kicks in the dark while the house sleeps. I get good, good enough to beat them all, and then the whole family splinters apart, the console disappearing into some storage box along with everything else we stop talking about. Not tonight, though.
Tonight, I remember how to win, and the match starts.
I botch the first flash-kick, timing a hair off, then instinct locks in, clean as a latch.
Low kick. Sonic Boom. Block, bait, punish.
Nicky jumps in sloppy, wild, trying to overwhelm me the way he overwhelms the room.
I catch him twice, hard.
Two matches. Quick, decisive.
The victory chime pops across the common room. Kids erupt. Cheers, shouts, a couple slaps to my back. Johnny steps forward, unable to believe it’s real, eyes bright and terrified at the same time. Joy booby-trapped.
Nicky doesn’t move. He just stares at the screen.
A muscle ticks, the grin snaps wrong, and he whips the controller back toward the glass.
It explodes against the wall by my leg; plastic cracks. Bone-sick sound.
Silence slams down.
Shards scatter near my foot.
The overhead light flickers white, dark, white, the building blinking in shock.
Nicky steps off the couch toward me. Slow, deliberate. The crowd retreats toward the tables, giving the two of us space whether they mean to or not.
“You think you’re hot shit?” His voice is low, dangerous.
“Maybe.”
I don’t move. I don’t give him the step he wants. Sweat slicks my palms. The couch presses behind my knees, the wall still at my back, the room gone still, hungry for blood.
Nicky gets in close, too close. The flicker splits his face in half, one side hollow and ghosted, the other burning.
His breath hits my cheek, hot, sour.
I glance at the shattered controller on the floor. Then at the twitch in his eye. Then at Johnny, frozen in the crowd, realizing what he asked me to do.
The world tilts.
Something in me steadies.
The last barrier gives.
I swing.
